- 👋 Hi, my names are Musenya Ngoma but most call me Muse for brevity.
- 👀 My sweet spot for software development is developing apps for Android devices. I wouldl say I have a solid understanding of technical frameworks. With each passing day, I add onto my existing knoweledge with the goal of becoming exceptionally proficient in my art.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin + Jetpack Compose. So, most of the projects you will see in my repositories would have been done using Kotlin.
- 💞️ I took up Android app development firstly because I wanted to make the most use of my Windows PC. Secondly, I'd love to bring to life the many ideas I have hoarded in my mind.
- Thank you for your interest!! :)
